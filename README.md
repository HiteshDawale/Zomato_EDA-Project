# Zomato_EDA-Project
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Zomato dataset using Python. The EDA process involves a thorough examination of the dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Below is an overview of the steps and methodologies employed in this analysis.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Loading the Data: Importing the dataset using pandas.
Cleaning the Data: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and converting existing ones to appropriate formats for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics of numerical columns.
Distribution of categorical variables.
Correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features.
Data Visualization
Univariate Analysis: Histograms, box plots, and count plots to analyze individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to study relationships between pairs of features.
Multivariate Analysis: Pair plots and grouped bar charts to explore interactions among multiple features.
Insights
Identification of popular cuisines and restaurants.
Analysis of average costs and price ranges across different cities.
Patterns in user ratings and votes.
Availability and impact of table bookings and online delivery services.
Conclusion
The EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the Zomato dataset, highlighting significant trends and insights. These findings can be used to inform business decisions, improve customer experiences, and guide further analysis.

Future Work
Potential future work includes:

Predictive modeling to forecast restaurant ratings or customer preferences.
